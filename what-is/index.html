          <p>Sudoku is a widely popular logic-based number puzzle that challenges the mind and enhances logical thinking. Although it is often associated with numbers, Sudoku is not about arithmetic or calculations, but about reasoning and pattern recognition.</p>
          <p>The modern Sudoku puzzle was popularized in Japan in the 1980s, though its origins can be traced back to number puzzles published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe. The word “Sudoku” comes from the Japanese phrase “Sūji wa dokushin ni kagiru,” which means “the numbers must remain single.”</p>
          <p>A standard Sudoku puzzle consists of a 9×9 grid, divided into nine 3×3 subgrids, known as boxes. Some numbers are already filled in (called givens), and the player must fill in the remaining squares so that each row, column, and 3×3 box contains all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.</p>
          <p>Sudoku comes in various difficulty levels, from easy puzzles that require basic logic to advanced puzzles demanding sophisticated techniques and strategies. Players rely on deduction, elimination, and logical reasoning to solve each puzzle step by step.</p>
          <h2 style="margin:12px 0 8px;font-size:18px;font-weight:600;color:#111">Benefits of playing Sudoku:</h2>
